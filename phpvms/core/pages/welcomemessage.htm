	Hello all and welcome to the Hawaiian Airways PHPVMS system. This system will be used for logging all flights from now. You will need to sign up using the link and then once your registration has been accepted, you will be able to log flights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This system will be used for all passenger and cargo flights including OAVA flights. It will also cover all destinations across Hawaii, the UK and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>
	The system will ask you for your fuel used when logging a PIREP. As a standard rule of thumb, each kg of fuel is 0.01% on YSFlight. Therefore, if I used 10% of YSFlight fuel on my flight, I will put 1000kg in the PIREP.</p>
<p>
	Flights will be booked with specific flight numbers. Each flight number will have a specific departing and arriving airport. For example, if I wanted to fly from Honolulu to Maui, the flight number assigned to that route is 001 and that is what I would put in the flight number section. <strong>A list of the routes is avaliable here:&nbsp;<a href="http://hawaiianairwayspireps.comoj.com/phpvms/index.php/schedules/view">http://hawaiianairwayspireps.comoj.com/phpvms/index.php/schedules/view</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
	The 737 Max 7 will be assigned to all routes as standard but <strong>YOU DO NOT NEED TO FLY WITH IT. You can select your aircraft of choice when filling in the PIREP.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
	You also <strong>DO NOT</strong> have to do the flight at the time specified on the flight. For example, if HA001 is supposed to be flown at 8pm, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to fly it at 8pm.</p>
<p>
	Not all routes will be on the system and it will be gradually built up over time, if you would like to request a route to fly please do so using the form below. The route will be added as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
	We appreciate that this is a slightly challenging system to use, however we believe it is very professional and a step in the right direction for our VA.</p>
<p>
	I hope you all enjoy this system and contact me if you need anything.&nbsp;</p>
